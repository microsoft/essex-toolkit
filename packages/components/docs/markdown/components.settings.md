## Settings variable

A zero-config settings panel that parses a supplied object and generates a list of Fluent UI controls based on the data types. A config object can be supplied that maps specific object fields to more detailed control config, such as changing between a Toggle or Checkbox. In addition, it will invoke a onChange handler for any setting, supplying the changed setting's key and new value. Note that this could be used in an entirely declarative/serializable manner if desired.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
Settings: ({ settings, config, groups, onChange, }: SettingsProps) => JSX.Element
```
