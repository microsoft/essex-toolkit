## ClippedGraph variable

Creates a line chart that handles extreme distributions with a few clipping/wrapping strategies. The "clipped graph" concept was presented by Haihan Lin at VIS2019. https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2019\_infovis\_clipped\_graphs/ This chart can also produce a horizon plot, or be formatted to look like a sparkline. For examples of these variants, see the visual sandbox: https://visualsandbox.azurewebsites.net/\#/experiments/clipped-graphs

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
ClippedGraph: ({ data, width, height, clipped, percentile, gradient, gradientInterpolation, gradientBand, horizon, sparkline, }: ClippedGraphProps) => JSX.Element
```
