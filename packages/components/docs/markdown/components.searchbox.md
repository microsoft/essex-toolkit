## SearchBox variable

Extends the idea of a SearchBox to include the Search button alongside the text field. Note that this is a compound TextField + PrimaryButton. We may want to switch the the Fluent SearchBox field, which includes autocomplete capability.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
SearchBox: ({ defaultValue, label, placeholder, errorMessage, onSearch, }: SearchBoxProps) => JSX.Element
```
