## SettingsProps.settings property

Settings object to render into a settings panel. This can be basically anything, but should be flat at the moment, as complex/nested objects are not supported. Note that this can be undefined if a config is supplied.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
settings?: any;
```
