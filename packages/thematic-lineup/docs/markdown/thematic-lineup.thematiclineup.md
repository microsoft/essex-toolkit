## ThematicLineup variable

This component manages a LineUp instance, while also applying default thematic styles and data colors. Use it for a React-style JSX wrapper around LineUp that has more potential flexibility than the very config-limited version exposed by the LineUp project. This allows arbitrary column configs via JSON, and a set of global filters if desired.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
ThematicLineup: ({ data, columns, filters, patternParams, histograms, defaultSortColumn, defaultSortAscending, width, height, }: ThematicLineupProps) => JSX.Element
```
