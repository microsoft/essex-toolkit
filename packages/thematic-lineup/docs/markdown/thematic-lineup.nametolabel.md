## nameToLabel variable

Converts a column name to a label by uppercasing the first letter. This is used here because LineUp does not expose the names to us once the instance is built, so we often have to filter based on the label. Note that this is error-prone, because the label could be hand set by a dev. See https://github.com/lineupjs/lineupjs/blob/23ca83caefc3200156d4a3af5d1f14c59db76657/src/builder/column/ColumnBuilder.ts\#L7
