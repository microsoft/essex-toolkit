## thematic-lineup package

## Enumerations

|  Enumeration | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [FilterOperation](./thematic-lineup.filteroperation.md) | Filter operation to apply. TODO: complete the impls. |
|  [FilterType](./thematic-lineup.filtertype.md) | Type of filter to apply. TODO: round out the other data types supported by LineUp. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [CategoricalColumnConfig](./thematic-lineup.categoricalcolumnconfig.md) |  |
|  [ColumnConfig](./thematic-lineup.columnconfig.md) |  |
|  [Filter](./thematic-lineup.filter.md) | Filter definition. |
|  [LinkColumnConfig](./thematic-lineup.linkcolumnconfig.md) |  |
|  [NumberColumnConfig](./thematic-lineup.numbercolumnconfig.md) |  |
|  [ThematicLineupProps](./thematic-lineup.thematiclineupprops.md) |  |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [applyFilters](./thematic-lineup.applyfilters.md) | Apply a list of Filters to a LineUp instance. |
|  [buildBooleanColumn](./thematic-lineup.buildbooleancolumn.md) | Builds a boolean-based column, which is a variant on categorical. Lineup only provides a subset of builders, so this wraps it with explicit typing. |
|  [buildCategoricalColumn](./thematic-lineup.buildcategoricalcolumn.md) | Builds a categorical column, computing the unique categories as needed. |
|  [buildLinkColumn](./thematic-lineup.buildlinkcolumn.md) | Builds a link column, which is a string column where the text is a hyperlink. Note that pattern and params are optional config properties, that if omitted simply results in a plain string. |
|  [buildNumberColumn](./thematic-lineup.buildnumbercolumn.md) | Builds a standard number column, applying supplied domain or computing as needed. |
|  [buildSetColumn](./thematic-lineup.buildsetcolumn.md) | Builds a set-style column, which is a form of categorical column. Here we default the renderer to a heatmap. |
|  [buildStringColumn](./thematic-lineup.buildstringcolumn.md) | Builds a basic string column, which is also the default column type. |
|  [createNumberColorScale](./thematic-lineup.createnumbercolorscale.md) | Creates a nominal scale for numeric column assignment. This looks through the configs to count up the numeric columns, so that each one can be assigned a unique color from the scale. TODO: the scale function could be much more flexbile like d3 scales (domain/range), this just assumes an auto-incrementing index based on column order |
|  [deriveCategories](./thematic-lineup.derivecategories.md) | Gets unique list of categories for a column. If the data property used for the column is a single value, categoryKey is not required, because it is the same as |
|  [findColumn](./thematic-lineup.findcolumn.md) | find a lineup column using the label, because the id name is not copied to the final desc |
|  [nameToLabel](./thematic-lineup.nametolabel.md) | Converts a column name to a label by uppercasing the first letter. This is used here because LineUp does not expose the names to us once the instance is built, so we often have to filter based on the label. Note that this is error-prone, because the label could be hand set by a dev. See https://github.com/lineupjs/lineupjs/blob/23ca83caefc3200156d4a3af5d1f14c59db76657/src/builder/column/ColumnBuilder.ts\#L7 |
|  [selectColumnBuilder](./thematic-lineup.selectcolumnbuilder.md) | Selects the column builder function based on data type indicated on the config. TODO: support additional LineUp column types |
|  [ThematicLineup](./thematic-lineup.thematiclineup.md) | This component manages a LineUp instance, while also applying default thematic styles and data colors. Use it for a React-style JSX wrapper around LineUp that has more potential flexibility than the very config-limited version exposed by the LineUp project. This allows arbitrary column configs via JSON, and a set of global filters if desired. |
